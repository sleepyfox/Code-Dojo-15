Code Dojo 15
============
This is the base code from the 15th meeting of the London Code Dojo in mid Dec 2012. Feel free to play around with it. Please read the file 'Gilded Rose kata.md' for details on what the kata involves and how the exercise is structured. The objective is not just to add a feature to the code, but also to add tests to (bad) legacy code and to refactor the code into something much more maintainable and extensible. Good luck!

Other versions of the Gilded Rose starter code for different languages can be found at:

* C# [link](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose)
* Ruby [link](https://github.com/jimweirich/gilded_rose_kata)
* Java [link](https://github.com/alexaitken/GildedRose_java)
* Python [link](https://github.com/Kyoku57/gildedRosePythonVersion)
* Clojure [link](https://github.com/mjansen401/gilded-rose-clojure)
* Javascript [link](https://github.com/guyroyse/gilded-rose-javascript)

There is a CoffeeScript version of the starter code in the ['coffee'](./coffee/) folder; from within that folder you can install dependencies automatically with:
```bash
    npm install
```

You can run the included code in this project with:
```bash
    npm test
```
